<p><b>Jeremy</b> Today at 8:47 PM</p>
<p>hey, need to ask something</p>
<p>you don't have to answer</p>
<p><b>Jessica</b> Today at 8:49 PM</p>
<p>Go for it</p>
<p><b>Jeremy</b> Today at 8:51 PM</p>
<p>has Anthony looked ok to you lately?</p>
<p>Kat's worried, me too</p>
<p><b>Jessica</b> Today at 8:52 PM</p>
<p>Is this about today's stream?</p>
<p><b>Jeremy</b> Today at 8:52 PM</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p><b>Jessica</b> Today at 8:52 PM</p>
<p>God</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p><b>Jeremy</b> Today at 8:58 PM</p>
<p>Jess?</p>
<p>what happened</p>
<p><b>Jessica</b> Today at 9:03 PM</p>
<p>They had a fight yesterday</p>
<p>Not a pretty one</p>
<p>Did not come to a compromise about some of his life choices</p>
<p>And his friends</p>
<p>And me</p>
<p>Wasn't supposed to hear that</p>
<p>But it happens like twice a month, so he's used to get over it</p>
<p>This one was worse, he seems down ever since</p>
<p>I tried to talk to him, but he just shrugs it off </p>
<p>Totally wasn't supposed to tell you all this</p>
<p><b>Jeremy</b> Today at 9:15 PM</p>
<p>fucking hell</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Jeremy leaned back in the chair.</p>
<p>He still could see the image of that Jackbox round before his eyes.</p>
<p>
  <em> Which statement about Chilled is true? </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> "Either both true, or… now it's awkward." </em>
</p>
<p>His brain tried to shove the image away, but the two cards on the screen couldn't leave his thoughts. One was a silly Chilled thing, just another bit that they could all continue laughing about, just a goofy fact. <em> Very special </em>, Jeremy would say if someone asked him. Just like this smartass Chilled, his optimistic, jokingly paranoid, loudly hotheaded, loyal and trusting friend.</p>
<p>The other option, however, made Jeremy feel sick.</p>
<p>"I have a great relationship with my parents"</p>
<p>Chilled's lie. In the uppercase.</p>
<p>The radio silence that came after that game was terrifying. </p>
<p>***</p>
<p>"We need to talk to him."</p>
<p>He saw Kat lift her head. Her hand fell loose on the cat sitting on her knees; the cat opened her eyes looking unsatisfied.</p>
<p>Kat sighed.</p>
<p>"The thing is," she started warily, "he might be totally okay with whatever is happening to him."</p>
<p>Jeremy had this idea in his head; as much as he was worried about his friend Chilled, <em>Anthony</em>, on the other hand, was an adult, who wouldn't accept help from anyone, who would totally try to handle his problem on his own.</p>
<p>"He might be dealing with it just alright, and bringing up the problem might just make it worse."</p>
<p>She was right, as always.</p>
<p>A squirming feeling rose up in his chest: Jeremy needed to be wary with his next actions.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>"How's the day, buddy?" Jeremy asked, trying to keep his tone casual.</p>
<p>He succeeded, he noticed, when Chilled answered enthusiastically, "The day's amazing, we went to the falls today, spent like twenty bucks on ice cream. Rex pulled us into the water, so we both were soaking wet for like an hour."</p>
<p>Jeremy smiled. "I bet you were looking like puppies that got caught in the rain."</p>
<p>"Oh, we absolutely did."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>
  <em> "Are you an only child?" </em>
</p>
<p><em> "No, I have siblings," </em> Chilled responded in a conversation with Ze.</p>
<p><em> "Are they older than you?" </em> Ze asked, still looking at the map, trying to find Hope town in Canada.</p>
<p><em> "They are. I'm the youngest. We don't really talk much these days." </em> Chilled also was staring at the map.</p>
<p>
  <em> "You do give off the youngest sibling vibe…" </em>
</p>
<p>Jeremy closed the video.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>"Let's go!" Kat yelled as the screen showed Chilled win as the Jester.</p>
<p>"Good job, Chilled!" Jeremy echoed, smiling. "It was amazing!"</p>
<p>He could hear Chilled giggle lightly in return.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>
  <em> "...so I swapped myself with Chelsea thinking I was gonna die." </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> "You murdered Chelsea like that?!" </em>
</p>
<p><em> "Yeah, I killed Chelsea like that," </em> Chilled responded with a guilty voice, <em> "but the good news is that I'm still… eh… that's not really good news…" </em></p>
<p>Jeremy wanted to throw up, honestly. Ze was on watch out duty today, playing Town of Salem, but Jeremy happened to be on the stream as a viewer anyways.</p>
<p>He focused on the rest of the game.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>"I'm so sorry Jeremy I had to throw you under the bus…" There were the two of them on the victory screen, and Chilled pulled it off perfectly, when all the hope was seemingly gone.</p>
<p>"You clutched that shit, dude!" Jeremy yelled, with a smile in his voice.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Anthony was very aware that he fucked up.</p>
<p>Despite his nature, Chilled liked that little bit of privacy he had: it wasn't even about fans, really. Fans were amazingly forgetful.</p>
<p>His friends, in fact, were not.</p>
<p>And, even if they were his friends, it didn't mean that he had every reason to unload whatever was happening between him and his old family.</p>
<p>(He knew that he probably needed to talk to someone about that, but he couldn't handle the pity they would most likely look at him with.)</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>"Can I ask you something?" It was pretty much the first time when Jeremy was in the private call with Chilled since the game of Jackbox. They didn't stream before that, and they were not going to. Jeremy couldn't even remember what the conversation started with, but he decided that it should end with a serious talk. Chilled hummed in affirmation, Jeremy breathed in and out, and asked carefully, "Do you think we're gonna leave you behind if we learn about bad things in your life?"</p>
<p>"What?.." Chilled's voice was so quiet, it pained Jeremy. "Oh… Is this about the parents thing?"</p>
<p>After a little pause Jeremy answered, "Kind of."</p>
<p>Anthony hesitated with the response; Jeremy wondered if he was going to leave the call. But he didn't leave, and just said, with the same quiet voice, "It's not about your reaction, at least not entirely. It's all my own problems that no one could really help me to solve."</p>
<p>It was obvious he wasn't saying everything he had in his mind.</p>
<p>But Jeremy wasn't gonna push.</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>Jeremy didn't go for another question. A creeping feeling was rising in Anthony's chest - he didn't really know how he expected Jeremy to respond, and the silence in the call wasn't helping to lift it off.</p>
<p>"We would like you and Jess to come over for a hangout."</p>
<p>Anthony let out the breath he didn't realize he was holding. He felt warmth push the uncomfortable feeling away.</p>
<p>"There will be others. Ze, Tom, Aphex, Cheesy and Zoe were gonna come too. Platy is still in the area, so he'll be there as well."</p>
<p>Chilled smiled to himself.</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>`;
